# MachineLearning
Training codes for various problems solved with machine learning.

## ZPS - head to the README below
[WAWTPC](WAWTPC/README.md) - regression task. Reconstruct 3D positions of track endpoints from three 2D projections: U, V, W.
The projections share a common axis: **Z**, but the other exes are **not orthogonal**.

----
[TauTauMass](TauTauMass/README.md) - regression problem. Reconstruct the full tau-tau system invariant mass, having the
data as from High Energy Physics (HEP) detector: four momenta of all particles except for neutrinos.
For neutrinos we have only the vectorial sum of momenta in a given plane.
